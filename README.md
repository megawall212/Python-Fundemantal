## 📖 About

This repository contains most of the code from **COP3502C – Programming Fundamentals 1** at the **University of Florida**, written in **Python**.  
It includes all the **labs**, **extra credit assignments**, and the **final group project** (approximately 90% complete).

The course was taught by **Ashish Aggarwal** during **Fall 2024**, when I took it as a **freshman** in Computer Engineering.
